## Hi there    ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆðŸŒŸ

ThinkR is above all a **team united by a common passion: R**.

Passionate about data, believing strongly in the **power of open source**, our team is committed every day to, and with, the user community. Coming from different backgrounds, our **expeRts** know how to bring a new and unique perspective on R, and hope to participate, on their own scale, in the construction of the future of the most popular language in the world of data science.

Whether you call on us for your **development**, **training** or **analysis**, we are here to provide you with a unique service: the one driven by a passion for a language in constant evolution, which we like to learn, relearn, but above all to make you learn and share.
